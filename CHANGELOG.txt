v 1.0.0
    Initial release. Supports Windows and 4K HDR resolution. 
v 1.1.0
    Added support for MacOS and Linux
        -Tested on MacOS 11.0.1 "Big Sur"
        -Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    Updated help based comments for script functions
v 1.2.0
    Completely overhauled help based comments to be more organized and...helpful
    Added -Help parameter to easily view new help comments and examples
v 1.2.1
    Changed min-keyint value to preset default
    Lowered keyint value from 250 to 120 (seeks every 4 frames). This was an error on my part and was not meant to be that high
v1.3.1
    Changed output to a log file instead of the console. On Windows, ffmpeg creates a new line for each frame and the buffer cannot store the entire history
    Created new function Set-RootPath, which sets the path for the crop file and log file. Logic partially removed from New-CropFile function
    Changed test encodes to start at the 10 minute mark. It still only encodes 1000 frames, but it will be better test material than the intro screens/logos
v1.3.2
    Fixed empty path error in New-CropFile function. The crop path variable was declared globally, but there was some kind of scoping issue 
        which was causing it to be empty. Set-RootPath now returns an object containing the crop and log paths.
