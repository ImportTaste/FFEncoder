# FFEncoder

FFEncoder is a script that is meant to make high definition video encoding easier. FFEncoder uses [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and the [x265 HEVC encoder](https://x265.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) to compress 4K HDR (3840x2160) and 1080p (1920x1080) video files to be used for streaming or archiving.
